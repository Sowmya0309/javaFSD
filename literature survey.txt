Abstract:

The success of modern agriculture and plant breeding depends on accurate and efficient data collection. For commercial companies that manage large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck. Due to limited time and labor, phenotyping crops accurately is virtually impossible.
To succeed in modern farming and plant breeding, one needs an accurate and efficient collection of data. For organizations that manage large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck.


Metholody:

In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method, DeepCorn, to count the kernels in an image of corn ears taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions. We use the number of counted kernels to estimate yield.
Corn ear images contain a wide range of pixel sizes due to scaling variations and genetically different kernel shapes and colors. The proposed method should be able to counter such variations and learn both highly semantic levels.

2.2. Kernel Counting Using Proposed Model

Our ground truth density maps are generated in such a way that the summation over the density map equals the number of kernels in the image.
This property enables the proposed model to count the number of kernels in an image as an auxiliary task while learning how much each region contributes to the overall count.
So, the proposed method is trained end-to-end to predict the density maps where the number of kernels can be readily estimated by summation over the predicted density maps at inference time.

2.3. Network Loss
In Equation 1, we use the Euclidean loss to train the network. The Euclidean loss is a popular loss in crowd counting literature since it enhances the quality of estimated densities.
